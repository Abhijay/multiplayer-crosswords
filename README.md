## Washington Post Crosswords

Made redundant by recent update to the post crossword app, hence releasing to public.
Allows for multiplayer input on washington post crosswords. To use, run `app.js` on a local or hosted server, and visit the proper port.

A few bugs here and there but mostly completely functional. Uses sockets, node+express, and a little js injection.
